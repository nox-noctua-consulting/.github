Welcome to Nox Noctua Consulting's Github account.

Here you will find resources for projects that we are involved in.

Please feel free to look around and use whatever you wish (unless it is not GPL/MIT licenced (because that project may be commissioned work and is therefore owned by the commissioner)).

If you wish to be involved in any of the open source projects, please reach out. I am sure it would be great to have the help.
