# Nox Noctua Consulting

Welcome to Nox Noctua Consulting's Github account.

Here you will find resources for projects that we are involved in.

# Usage

Please feel free to look around and use whatever you wish (unless it is not GPL/MIT licenced (because that project may be commissioned work and is therefore owned by the commissioner)).

# Involvement

If you wish to be involved in any of the open source projects, please reach out. 
I am sure it would be great to have the help.

# Support

If you'd like to support any of our projects, please feel free to make a donation.
